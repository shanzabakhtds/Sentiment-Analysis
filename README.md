# Sentiment-Analysis

Built a machine learning model that predicted the sentiment of a movie review. Sentiment analysis, an NLP technique, was utilized to determine whether data was positive, negative, or neutral. It was particularly beneficial for businesses as it aided in understanding the overall opinions of their customers.

For this project, an IMDB dataset containing 50k movie reviews was used, featuring two columns (review and sentiment). The goal was to build the best machine learning model capable of predicting the sentiment given a movie review. To ensure the project's beginner-friendliness, the task was narrowed down to predicting whether a movie review was positive or negative. This simplified approach was known as binary text classification due to the presence of only two possible outcomes.
